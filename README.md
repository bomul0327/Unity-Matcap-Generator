# Unity-Matcap-Generator

## Overview

 This is a simple matcap texture generator for Unity users. You can check a generated matcap texture in realtime. Also, you can save the texture if you want. This one can generate various types of material, if you can handle unity's rendering system, such as lights, materials, shaders or something else.

 The detailed documentation will be added at Wiki soon.

## Checked Unity version
* 2018.4.14
* 2019.2.16f1

 I didn't check URP or HDRP version. It may works but you need to modify a material, because the Standard shader in Unity is not supported in URP or HDRP.
